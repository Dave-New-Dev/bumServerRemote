# bumServerRemote
## Description:
Remote for the bums to start up the bum server when they're away.

## Important note:
This is only the transmitting/outgoing side of the remote, not the receiving/incoming side; in other words, this is for the client(s), not for the server. For the server/receiving end, see https://github.com/Dave-New-Dev/bumServerRemote-1
